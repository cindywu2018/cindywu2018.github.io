Here comes the much anticipated Thanksgiving Break!!!

# 1. What did you do this past week?
We finished the last phase of our web application! We implemented a search functionality to query our tables and made finishing touches on our website. The final product looks a lot better than when we first started, but there could still be a lot of improvements, such as better formatting in the search results and overall aesthetics. Finally, we also started on our presentation. 

# 2. What's in your way?
We only have 2 days of classes this week, so the major obstacle that hinders me from getting work done is the procrastination from the break. 

# 3. What will you do next week?
Finish and refine our project presentation, try to do my homework early and start studying for the last SWE test. Also spend time with friends and family for Thanksgiving!! 

# My experience in the class:
This week was relatively easy. I am familiar with the concepts we learned in class, so this week felt more like review to me. We went over dynamic binding and the Singleton strategy pattern in Java, and then on Wednesday, we had guest speakers from Spiceworks come talk about their company and how to succeed in an industry. I heard a lot about Spiceworks and how fun it is to work for them, and hearing from them first hand was pretty nice. On Friday, we learned that Java has a neat reflection API that can examine and change the run time behavior of a class (at run time, of course). I can see how the lectures can be useful to software development, and I'm glad to know more about design patterns.

# Tip of the week:
Have fun and be safe back home! Enjoy the break but also don't forget about the deadlines.
