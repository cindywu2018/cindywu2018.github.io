# 1. What did you do this past week?
This past week was super busy for me. I had lots of interviews on top of regular school work, and we also had our SWE test.

# 2. What's in your way?
Nothing big, just the regular "how do I efficiently manage my schedule".

# 3. What will you do next week?
Continue working on homework and projects. I think we are going to finally start project 3 for SWE! Additionally, I need to continue preparing for interviews, since I will be flying out to a few on site interviews later this month.

# My experience in the class:
The first exam went okay. We had (more than) enough time to complete the coding questions, and there weren't even any reading questions (unlike OOP last year, when I spent too much time answering reading questions and not enough time on coding). The questions are fair. Also, I thought since I took OOP exams on Canvas already, I wouldn't mind the manual indentations during SWE exam. Nope, that was wrong. Thankfully, the "Preformatted" option on Canvas text box made the typing experience better. Finally, I should have studied more for this test, but this week I was just running all over the place. Anyway, I hope I did okay.

# Tip of the week:
[Repl](https://repl.it/languages) is a great place to run code online. You can choose different languages from Python to Javascript to HTML.
