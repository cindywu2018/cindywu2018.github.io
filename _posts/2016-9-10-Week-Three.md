The time when I finally understood the difference between a tuple and a set.

# 1. What did you do this past week?
Last week was when the Collatz projects were due, so I spent more time on Piazza and office hours answering students questions, and at the same time working on my own Collatz project for SWE. In addition, I also polished up my resume and started applying for jobs. 

# 2. What's in your way?
Working as a TA is admittedly more work and responsibilities than I imagined. For example, working on the weekends, communicating with other TAs and especially students, new experiences with the pull requests, all the while committing to my five other classes and have a decent social life. However, I still stand firmly in my ability to work this semester out. It's all a learning experience.

# 3. What will you do next week?
Next week I will continue grading the Collatz projects, finish my own programming projects and readings, and get better from my cold. I felt like I haven't breathed properly in a while.

# My experience in the class:
The daily quizzes will be the death of me again. I know I shouldn't base my competency in those quizzes *alone*, but it's quite discouraging seeing my grade right now because I didn't do so well on the quizzes. As for the course material, I am enjoying the Python lectures so far. We talked about the different data structures in Python (dictionary, list, tuple, set), list slicing, and hashing. I learned += and + with lists and tuples, and I finally understood what a tuple and a set is. Tuples are immutable and hashable, while sets are the mutable and non-hashable. I also learned that I've been pronouncing tuple wrong the entire time.

# Tip of the week:
Because of the exercises we did in class on sets, tuples, and lists, I did more research on the data structures. I found a good explanation of [when to use a dict/tuple/set](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3489071/in-python-when-to-use-a-dictionary-list-or-set). This page also offers a good review of what we learned in class too.
