That week when I (and everyone else) freak out over coding interviews.

# 1. What did you do this past week?
This past week was the busiest I've had so far, filled with career fair, networking, interviews, and regular class assignments.

# 2. What's in your way?
Time management I guess. I work better when I'm in a steady busy-ness state, but I'm not an expert with managing my time wisely. I got through the week with minimum damage to my mental and academic states I think. The interviews went well, for the most part, and my assignments were done well, for the most part.

# 3. What will you do next week?
Start the new SWE project. I hope we are starting on the web application next week! Also a lot of catching up, since I missed a few classes because of the career fair and interviews.

# My experience in the class:
This class is really helping me with Python programming, which I appreciate. A speaker from JPL came on Wednesday, and it was so cool hearing about his project and work experience. The demo about Mars was also really interesting.

# Tip of the week:
Since we are in the middle of interviewing season, make sure your resume is the most updated and that all the information (I mean, every single word on that sheet of paper) is accurate and truthful. Remember, everything you put down on the resume is fair game to interviewers, so you need to be prepared to answer questions that refer to any part of your resume. Finally, don't forget to have fun in your interviews and learn something new from each one. The most important part of an interview (aside from getting the job) is to learn from it!
