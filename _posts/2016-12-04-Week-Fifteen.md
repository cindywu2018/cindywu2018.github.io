The last week of Software Engineering

# 1. What did you do this past week?
We presented our final website to the entire class and received really good critiques of our project. I listened to other project presentations and was really impressed by the creativity and talent of some students in my class. Finally, we ended our class with the second exam, which was a bit harder than the first exam but still pretty fair, and it did test our knowledge of this class. There was again, more than enough time to take the exam.

# 2. What's in your way?
Nothing anymore! I will be finished everything I needed for this class when I submit this blog.

# 3. What will you do next week?
I will finish my other academic and work obligations. Hope to end this semester on a happy note!

# My experience in the class:
This class is really worthwhile taking and beneficial for several reasons. First of all, Professor Downing is considerate and lenient. He constantly asks for feedback from students and listens to what students have to say and adjust his class based on students' suggestions. Therefore, you won't feel like your opinion is not valuable. Second, he incorporates a lot of modern technologies/tools into the projects, so when you take his class you get exposure to really useful tools such as Pylint, Travis-CI, Flask, or Bootstrap that are all important to software engineering. Professor Downing also encourages students to explore more tools on our own. Third, the class is well organized and you will end up learning something new or get a better understanding of a concept you already know every week. Finally, the final web application project will teach you a lot about teamwork, design, and programming, and at the end of it, you get to show up your website to recruiters! Overall, I had a great time in Software Engineering, and I definitely recommend all the CS students to take this class before they graduate.

# Tip of the week:
It's the end of the semester, don't you just feel like you ran out of fuel but still have to keep going like:

That is a picture I took of my computer this morning. Clearly my poor device is super exhuasted, but luckily it's being charged right now. The moral of the picture is to remind everyone to recharge yourself and get not too hung up on the fact that you are exhuasted. You can achieve more than you imagine if you focus on the goal and ask support from others around you instead of focusing on your tiredness.
