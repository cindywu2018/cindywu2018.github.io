# 1. What did you do this past week?
The usual - I got started on the new OOP project, finished some programming assignments and did my readings. I also got to bond with my roommates some more, which is always nice.

# 2. What's in your way?
There wasn't too much in my way last week, mostly just the lack of concentration from getting sick the past week.

# 3. What will you do next week?
Finish the Netflix project, make sure I'm all caught up in my other classes (I've been procrastinating, sadly). I also have an interview coming up, so I need to be prepared for any possible coding questions. I will also go to the career fair on Tuesday, and hopefully land a few interviews. This upcoming summer will be my last internship opportunity, so I will make sure to make it count.

# My experience in the class:
Last week we went deeper into the magical world of Python (heh, magic functions, get it?) and I reviewed my knowledge in Python arithmetics and reduce() function. As usual, I can see where we can apply this knowledge in our current project. On Wednesday we had a guest speaker from Bloomberg talk about his experience at the company and working as a software engineer. He emphasized the importance of paying attention in this class because it helped him in his career, which comforted me since it appears that I paid more attention than him in this class, haha. All in all, nothing crazy went on this week, which I was thankful for.

# Tip of the week:
Interviews are scary. Messing up because you don't know the answer to a simple question is even scarier. Since I figured everyone here would try their best to attend the career fair, I feel like reminding everyone the importance of understanding basic programming skills and concepts, such as data structures, algorithms, and run time complexities. I review this [Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com) whenever I have an interview to prepare for, because 95% of the time, the interviewer will ask you something related to data structures and their repsective run time efficiencies. Good luck on the job hunting, everyone!
