# 1. What did you do this past week?
After finishing the Darwin Project, I was surprisingly not really busy afterwards so I started planning my schedule for next semester. I was glad to get a well deserved break and spend quality time with friends just watching YouTube and making Ramen.

# 2. What's in your way?
Writing all those unit tests was for sure, a pain. We had so many functions of our own so the number of unit tests we had to write was well above 100. On the bright side, at least our project has good object-oriented features right?

# 3. What will you do next week?
Next week is going to be spent working on the 5th OOP project and more studying. I will focus on finishing all my assignments, hopefully early so I have more free time for myself.

# My experience in the class:
Well, before the Darwin project, I never knew how hard it is to avoid using getters and setters in programming. I also learned the pain of writing a ton of unit tests all in one afternoon. I also did not know that C++ supports optional arguments like Python does, that's pretty neat. I'm liking C++ more than when I first started this class, that's for sure.

# Tip of the week:
Make a LinkedIn profile and try to add company recruiters as your connections. Don't forget to periodically update your profile and stay in touch with your connections. You never know if you can get a job interview from that.
