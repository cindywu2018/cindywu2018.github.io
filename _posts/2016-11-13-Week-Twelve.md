# 1. What did you do this past week?
We started on the last phase of the project. We made more progress on refining the splash page, but there still needs to be more work. The search engine is slowly coming along, and we've set our user stories already.

# 2. What's in your way?
Nothing unusual. Just time management, especially when it's getting closer to dead week and everything is due.

# 3. What will you do next week?
Finish the last phase and start on the presentation.

# My experience in the class:
This week we learned about different strategy patterns to make code more object-oriented and easier to change, and on Friday we talked about method overriding. I am familiar with the strategy practices we learned, but I didn't know the technical names of the strategies, so that was helpful. However, I didn't understand why we suddenly switched from Python to Java, and I wonder if it would be better to learn refactoring in Python? Finally, the quizzes. I had a lot of trouble with the quizzes this week, but it's a good thing we are getting some points back for one quiz due to error in the question.

# Tip of the week:
I found an article that talks about [refactoring in Python](http://hubpages.com/technology/How-To-Refactor-Code-In-Python-A-Beginners-Guide). It first introduces what refactoring is and when to use refactoring. It also informs you of some Python code refactoring tools. It's an interesting read, even if you're not interested in Python (which you should be), you can learn some good coding habits here too.
