# 1. What did you do this past week?
We started on the third project, met everyone in our team and decided on a topic for our website. We also started brainstorming what the interface would look like.

# 2. What's in your way?
Next week I will be out of town to Grace Hopper from Tuesday to Friday, so I am not able to meet with my group physically to finish the first phase of our project. I think this will be the biggest challenge for me, just finding time and communicating with my team over the internet. 

# 3. What will you do next week?
Attend Grace Hopper, take more interviews, finish Phase One, and also most likely play catch up with my class assignments.

# My experience in the class:
I feel that this class is going to get more interesting! We are working on Phase One of our web application, which is basically just the front end. We started by choosing a topic, which unfortunately took us a few days. Initially we wanted to do music and use the Spotify API, but later we learned that music or other kinds of entertainment is not allowed for this project. Next, we chose art, because it's really easy to find images/video/media feeds for art, but another group took the topic before us. Finally, we settled for a topic on open source projects, using the GitHub API, but more emphasis on the social aspect (such as project rating and the developers) rather than code.

# Tip of the week:
Get to know your team members. It will make working together more smoothly and friendly.
